            <p>The article focuses on monitoring plant physiology using wearable sensors, in order to increase the agricultural production. This new technique will analyze stomatal functions and volatile movements of plants, and it would be a cheaper way than traditional techniques. Moreover, it will not interfere with natural movements and processes of plants.    </p>
